# AdventofCode_2020
<p>
I'm Peter and I'm a second year Maths and CS student at the University of Bristol! Advent of code was shared on the CS society page and I decided to tackle it this year. I'm using IntelliJ to work on this in a single project over December. Hopefully I don't make a mess of things!

I reached day 18 this year before time got the better of me - I hope I can get further in the future :)
