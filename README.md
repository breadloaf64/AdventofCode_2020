# AdventofCode_2020

I'm Peter and I'm a second year Maths and CS student at the University of Bristol! Advent of code was shared on the CS society page and I decided to tackle it this year. I'm using IntelliJ to work on this in a single project over December. Hopefully I don't make a mess of things!
